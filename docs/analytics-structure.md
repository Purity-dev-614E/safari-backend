# Analytics Structure

This document outlines the role-based analytics structure in the Safari application.

## Overview

The analytics functionality is organized by user role, with each role having access to a specific set of analytics endpoints:

1. **Super Admin**: Global access to all analytics across the entire system
2. **Regional Manager**: Access limited to analytics within their assigned region
3. **Admin (Group Admin)**: Access limited to analytics for their specific group(s)

## Implementation Details

The analytics functionality is implemented with a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Controllers**: Separate controller files for each role
   - `superAdminAnalyticsController.js`
   - `regionalManagerAnalyticsController.js`
   - `adminAnalyticsController.js`

2. **Routes**: Separate route files for each role
   - `superAdminAnalyticsRoutes.js`
   - `regionalManagerAnalyticsRoutes.js`
   - `adminAnalyticsRoutes.js`

3. **Models**: Role-specific analytics models
   - `analyticsModel.js` - Used by super admin for global analytics
   - `regionAnalyticsModel.js` - Used by regional managers for region-specific analytics
   - `adminAnalyticsModel.js` - Used by group admins for group-specific analytics

4. **Access Control**: Role-based middleware ensures users can only access analytics appropriate to their role
   - Super admins can access all analytics
   - Regional managers can only access analytics for their region
   - Group admins can only access analytics for their groups

## Frontend Integration

When integrating with the frontend:

1. Use the appropriate base URL for each user role
2. The frontend should determine which analytics endpoints to use based on the user's role
3. For super admins and regional managers, the analytics structure is similar, with the only difference being the scope (global vs. region)
4. For group admins, the analytics are focused on their specific group(s)
